# Resourcepack for Incendium

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN THIS RESOURCEPACK, I AM JUST PROVIDING AN EASY WAY FOR SERVER ADMINS TO USE IT

This repository is a mirror of the resourcepack for Incendium by Stardust Labs.
Its purpose is to make it easier to install & modify.

It is set up in a way that will auto build when any changes are made.
To use the pack simply set the server resource pack in your `server.properties` to:

```
(url)
```

You can also fork and modify it, the auto build will persist.
Please note that you have to copy the hash from the release description, add it to your `server.properties`
and restart the server for the changes to take effect.
